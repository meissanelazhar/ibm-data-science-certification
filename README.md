# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Projects
Welcome to my personal repository containing projects and assignments from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. This collection showcases my journey through practical data science applications, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and predictive modeling.

About This Repository
Throughout this certification, I have worked on various hands-on projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to build real-world data science skills. The projects include:

Data Collection & APIs: Web scraping, API data retrieval (e.g., SpaceX API), and working with HTTP requests.

Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing raw datasets for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring and visualising data to uncover insights.

Predictive Modeling: Applying machine learning classification techniques.

Interactive Visualisations: Creating maps using Folium and dashboards with Plotly Dash.

Final Assignment: A comprehensive capstone project integrating the skills learned.
